        -- The countdown to Christmas has officially started and that can only mean one thing - it's time for the big shops to try and win us over with their heartwarming and tear jerking Christmas adverts.<br>

This year Marks and Spencer was one of the first to release their TV ad, which sees Paddington Bear become an unlikely hero.<br>

The famous bear saves Christmas as he unwittingly stops a hapless burglar and delivers all the stolen presents back to the good girls and boys.<br>

        However some aren't as impressed, and it's mainly because of one little detail.<br>

        Throughout the advert Paddington Bear calls his red hooded friend Santa, and at the end when he's feeling a bit more formal, Mr Claus.<br>

        However viewers claim that Paddington, who lives with the Brown family in London, should really be calling him Father Christmas.<br>

        One wrote: "Lovely advert but I am pretty sure that Paddington, living with the Brown family in London, as he does would refer to the chap in red as Father Christmas!"<br>
        
        Another viewer agreed, saying: "The browns would of definitely called the big man Father Christmas."<br>

        One Twitter user wrote: "Love it apart from the fact it's FATHER CHRISTMAS NOT SANTA. We are English."<br>

        Another added: "Please M&S ...it's 'Father Christmas'. You are a British retailer. #disappointed."<br>

        However many people immediately jumped to the advert's defence.<br>
        
Most people are completely in love with the adorable advert , with many claiming it's the company's best ever.
